# Black Devs London
### Author: Tacuma Bellford

## What?

Black Devs London is group for Black developers and designers in and around London
to get together, network and support each other in this ever advancing and changing 
field of technology. Currently we meet on the 1st of every month in the infamous event
space SkillsMatter/CodeNode. They have graciously given us a space to share ideas, support 
each other and network.

## Why?

Black Devs London began from the idea of being able to see representations of ourselves within
the tech community. So far it has been running for three months with the support of our friends
at MadeTech who are equally interested in establishing a more diverse work force.
